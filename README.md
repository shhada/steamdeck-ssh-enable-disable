# Steamdeck SSH enable/disable shortcuts
simple SteamOS desktop shortcuts made to enable and disable ssh.
i only use this to access my deck through FileZilla, if u find other uses for it, let me know c:
if you can turn it into a single shortcut that toggles between enabling and disabling, please do so bc my peanut brain doesn't know how to.
